##Required Features##    are added
1)  Modified the bubble movement to incorporate vertical motion such that the bubbles travel in a parabolic path. When the ball hits the horizontal ground, it bounce off the ground.
2)  Introduced  collision between the bubble and the bullet; the bubble disappears after a bullet hits it. After a collision,  bullet disappear .
3)  Introduced  collision between the bubble and the shooter; the shooter is dead if a bubble touches it.


Additional Features
1) Used bubbles of different sizes. When a bullet hits the larger bubble, it splits into smaller bubbles (half the radius of the original larger bubble) and move in horizontally opposite directions.
2)Added score, time and a health counter. The score increases whenever bullet hits a bubble. The game gets over when we run out of time (measured in seconds) or if we run out of health (whenever the bubble hits the shooter, the health reduces by 1).
